# Assumptions for URL Hashing/Shortening System

This document outlines the assumptions made during the development of the URL Hashing System for NewsBytes.

## User Behavior Assumptions
- Users frequently encounter issues with long URLs when copying them across various platforms (e.g., emails, spreadsheets), leading to formatting errors and tracking data loss.
- Users are familiar with using UTM parameters and require a seamless way to shorten URLs without losing essential tracking information.

## Technical Assumptions
- The application should support an unlimited URL length, implying that the hashing algorithm must efficiently handle various URL formats and their associated query parameters.
- The click tracking functionality is essential and should be designed to respect user privacy, possibly by anonymizing IP addresses or limiting the retention of tracking data.

## Performance Assumptions
- The system is expected to handle multiple concurrent requests without significant performance degradation, ensuring that users can quickly generate and track shortened URLs.

## Deployment and Development Assumptions
- The solution is expected to be deployable out of the box, suggesting that there should be minimal setup or configuration required for the end-user.
- While local development may be considered, the system must be compatible with AWS services, indicating an assumption that the cloud will be utilized for deployment and scalability.

## Security and Privacy Assumptions
- Given the emphasis on privacy-aware hashed URLs, there is an assumption that security measures will be implemented to protect user data and URL tracking information.

## Functionality Assumptions
- It is assumed that the generated URLs may be single-use or have limited use, requiring mechanisms to manage and validate the number of times a URL can be accessed.
- The architecture should include features that allow for scalability and easy maintenance, implying that the application will be built with modular components.
